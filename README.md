# Human-Computer Interaction🧑‍💻
🐯 Korea Univ, Fall 2024

Designing effective user interfaces requires a deep understanding of how humans interact with technology, beyond aesthetics. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles, guidelines, tools, and practices of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). You will explore a wide range of topics, including human cognitive and perceptual abilities, 2D and 3D interface design, multimodal interactions, interfaces for web and mobile devices, and methods for usability and evaluation. The course places a strong emphasis on practical applications, to engage in UI design and evaluation projects throughout the semester. Cheer up!🥳
