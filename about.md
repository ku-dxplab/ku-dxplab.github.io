## About
Welcome to [Course Name]! This course focuses on UI development, AI in UX, and building interactive systems. The course involves hands-on projects, including an AI-assisted ticketing service project.



This class teaches basic principles, guildelines, tools and practices of human computer interaction. The class will cover a broad range of issues starting with the human cognitive and perceptual capabilities, 2D interfaces, 3D and multimodal interfaces, interfaces for web and mobile devices, and usability and evaluation methods. The course will emphasize practical applications and thus require students to carry out many UI design and evaluation projects. The lectures will also try to use as many case studies as possible.
