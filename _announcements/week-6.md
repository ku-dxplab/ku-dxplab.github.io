1. Quizzes and HW 1 are being graded now. I need more time ~ M

2. For HW 2, a bit of more guideline ... what you need to include and the proportion of importance ...

    a. List of requirements (both functional and UI ... maybe in total, list up up to 7-8 major requirements) - 10%  
    b. Scenarios for 2-3 cases with pictures and annotations (I expect 3-4 pages per case) - 20%  
    c. User traits from the analysis and interview (4-5 items) - 15%  
    d. Important context information (4-5 items?) - 10%  
    e. Interview movie for 1 or 2 people - 1-2 min / each - 15%  
    f. interaction model: 1 page (or 1 diagram) - 15%  
    g. Presentation (7-8 pages of slides) - 15%  

3. HW 3 is out (HTML/JS exercise). Check.

4. Exercise for Human-Al interaction (which is semi-available on ku-dxplab.github.io) as official HW is being delayed.

It will be officially announced later this month as HW 4.
