Due the Chusok Holiday next week, we will not have lectures on Sept 16th and 18th.

I need to somehow come up with a plan for make-up lectures. It might be difficult to do this offline as people have different schedules … So I am considering recording video lectures instead …

I will keep you posted on this.
