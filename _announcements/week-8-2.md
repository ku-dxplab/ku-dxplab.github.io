For HW 4 submission of the wire-framing of the UI, please submit a Figma file that I should be able to execute using my own Figma on the web.

If you use some other software, please capture the simulation/execution on a video in short and submit it together.

Even for Figma, I advise you to still shoot a video (and submit), because often times, what you submit does not execute as smoothly as they should ....
