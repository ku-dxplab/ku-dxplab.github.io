There seems to be quite a number of students who are rather puzzled about HW 2.

1. I posted in the course material section, some samples of previously submitted homework (user research) for your guidedance.

Last semeseter the theme of the project was Web based diary. I am not saying the sample I posted are the best homework samples, but at least
they should

guide you as what to do for HW 2 (I hope).

2. Another student asked me and wondered that HW 2 was too broad, and one was not sure what to do. Here was my answer ...

" ... Yes it is broad. My advice is to look up the examples we studied in class (e.g. smart tv, mobile exercise guideline, small examples in the lecture
notes, ... ). As broad as it is, I won't be so strict in grading the homework. The important thing is how rich and deeply you have carried out the user
research. For example, I remember sometimes student's homework can be very skimpy - like 3-4 short sentences for requirements, just 1-2 pages
of hand drawn figures without any annotation, task models that have only 1 or 2 main functions, ... It is important to show you have spent the time
to think about the task, user, and so forth ... and I believe the time and effort spent will show somehow. I will not deduct points just because some
small parts are missing, but will try to see the big picture ... Basically whether your user research will make the difference down the road ... so as
to bring out the UX we want ... as distinguished from just going through the navie and lazy process ... "

I hope this gives may shed some light ~ ^^
