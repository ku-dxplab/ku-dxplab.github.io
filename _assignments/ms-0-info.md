You'llÂ DESIGN,Â BUILD, andÂ TESTÂ your own human-computer interaction system for `ðŸ¤–AI assisted Interactive Ticketing`.

You'll work { `in teams of n people` OR `independently` }, applying the concepts you've learned throughout the course. Below is the timeline and grading breakdown for each milestone.

{ timeline / grading table }

### **Does my project idea qualify?**

Your project is open-ended, but it must meet these criteria:

- Include a real AI technique in the background.
- Have a user interface, preferably a web-based human-computer interaction system. If the project focuses on data analysis, it should include a visualization or interactive analytics dashboard.
- Your prototype should focus on demonstrating the human-AI interaction concept rather than a fully developed platform (e.g., no need for a complete backend or login system).

### **Which parts of the system should I focus on?**

Backend services (e.g., databases, authentication) or detailed infrastructure (e.g., containerization, microservices) ****are **not required for this project**. While you may choose to implement backend services if they enhance the interaction between your AI and the UI (e.g., an AI inference server), you can also use **APIs or dummy data** to simplify the prototype.

The goal is to create an effective human-AI interaction, with an emphasis on **user experience and user interface** rather than building a complex AI system. Make sure to appropriately scope your project and focus on how the AI systemâ€™s output is controlled, adjusted, and visualized for the user.

### **Is Advanced AI Development Required?**

Note, **the performance of the AI system is not the key evaluation factor**. Instead, focus on how the AI system interacts with the user through the UI. The evaluation will center on how your AI responds to user input, how its output is controlled and adjusted for user interaction, and how this output is visualized.  Also, consider the user's role in this interaction, including how users provide input to the AI system and how they interpret and respond to the AIâ€™s output.

You should consider the following aspects for AI components:

- **Control**: How do you filter or refine the AI's output before presenting it to the user?
- **Adjustment**: How do you tailor the AIâ€™s output to provide relevant information in a simplified manner?
- **Visualization**: How do you effectively present the AI's results through intuitive graphs, charts, or visual design?

Designing for both **user inputs (or circumstances)** and **AI outputs** is essential for a complete user experience. Clearly explain in your project how youâ€™ve addressed these aspects, focusing on **what you considered and how you approached** both perspectives. addressed these aspects, focusing on what you considered and how you approached both perspectives. Exploring and demonstrating your AIâ€™s functionality (e.g., its strengths and limitations) through the prototype will help instructors understand your intentions.

### Examples

- TAâ€™s example

**How submit**
 : We'll create an assignment in KLUMS for each assignment.

**Late Policy**
: You'll lose **n%** for each late day. Submissions will be accepted until **three days after the deadline**. After then you'll get **0** on that assignment.
