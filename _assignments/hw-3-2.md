### 🛠️ How can I start?
Before starting, please watch the TA session video above.

---

1. Open [`Download Jupyter Notebook`](#-todo). Go to **File > Save a copy in Drive**. Make sure to work on your own copy, as changes made to the original template will not be saved. You must complete the assignment in the copy saved to your Google Drive.
2. Mount your Google Drive. (Run the first cell directly.)

As you proceed through the assignment, make sure to execute all cells in the notebook (shortcut: `Ctrl + Enter` OR `Cmd + Enter`).

- The sections marked `❓Discussion {num}` require you to write your reflections based on the results of the previous cells.
- The sections marked ✅ indicate where you need to implement your code.

Once you've implemented the code in all the ✅ cells, confirm that all cells have been executed. Finally, go to **File > Download** and save the notebook as `HW3-JohnSmith-2020345678.ipynb`.
