### 📋 Basic Guide for HW3 Notebook

- As you proceed through the assignment, make sure to execute all cells in the notebook (shortcut: `Ctrl + Enter` OR `Cmd + Enter`).
- The sections marked `❓Discussion {num}` require you to write your reflections based on the results of the previous cells.
- The `✅sections` indicate where you need to implement your code.

- Once you've implemented the code in all the ✅ cells, confirm that all cells have been executed. Finally, go to **File > Download > Download .ipynb** and save the notebook as `HW3-JohnSmith-2020345678.ipynb`.
