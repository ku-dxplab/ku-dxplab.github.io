Sketch out the interaction flow and detailed design of your (web-based) ticketing app using a wire-framing tool such as Adobe XD or Figma. If Adobe XD/Figma cannot fully describe your design, you can use Powerpoint/Word (or other medium) along with the wire-framing tool. 

For instance, if your application includes an external AI module, you can separately describe its prospective working in Word or Powerpoint, or attach captured drawings in the wire-framing file. Your presentation should highlight the major distinguishing features and include justifications for your design. You are free to update your interaction and interface design from Homework 1 and 2.
