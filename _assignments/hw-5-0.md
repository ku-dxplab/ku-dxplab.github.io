1. Implement your project â€“ (web based) ticketing. Unlike HW 3, this time, your user research results and detailed design should be reflected in the implementation to make it as usable as possible.
   - AI Implementation is optional (extra credit). You can also simulate the AI component (rather than true implementation).

2. Evaluate your output objectively.
   - Although this is your own project, perform an expert/heuristic evaluation (as if you are a third person). You can outline your own area of emphasis (which UI principles to focus more on) and carry out the evaluation around it.
